# homealarm project
Have you got a home alarm with a sim card and you want to move up a notch?
This project helps you create the perfect blend between cheap as f and awesome.

###All you need is:
* A crappy home alarm system that has a sim card tray and a sim card with an sms plan.
* An android phone (we use our personal phone but a dedicated one is better) with an internet data plan/wifi and a sms plan.
* An IFTT Account (Sign up here: [Join IFTT](https://ifttt.com/join))
* Beer

###All said, now throw on your webserver (yup, you need *AMP) the files from this github, configure proprely the files with your Maker token and IFTT token.
###Please note that you have to put correctly the country code(s) in order to make everything work propely.

###TODO
- [x] First kinda-working release
- [ ] Easy-to-use page with 'gui', hassle free, where you input tokens and phone numbers IE php setup script
- [ ] Create variables to control timing, actions, etc. IE php setup script
- [ ] Webapp with the [Install to home screen code](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/android/installtohomescreen)
